Docker it's basically a software to make app development more convenient, instead of using virtual machines with different OS,
and with the problem: "it worked on my computer, it's not my fault it is not working on yours". With Docker we use containers which is separated
from the actual machine, so everything will work in this container, and that way not matter which computer or OS it is going to run the 
application it will run perfectly.
